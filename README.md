*Commands that I would not otherwise use/remember* 

*will eventually format this with fancy hyperlinks and the like*



**General commands**


	sudo !! (run last command as root (!! means to run the last command))

	pkill -9 -f “program” (kill all instances of a program)
	
	Source .bashrc (enable the updated bashrc)
	
	ls -laht (long,all,humanreadable,time)
	
	du -sh file_path (see size of directory)
	





**Status commands**

	uname -a (show kernel version etc)

	less (pipe commands to this for easy reading (ls -la | less)

	df -h (drive information)

	free (memory information)

	ps -ef (list processes.)

	lsof (list open files)
	
	lsof -i:"portnum" (list services running on port)

	ps aux (current processes, aux flags = a - processs for all users, u - display process owner, x - 	show processes not attached to terminal)
	
	smartctl -a /dev/sda (lists abundence of information relating to hardrive health
	
	dmesg -H (dmesg with time stamps and in $PAGER (less default))	

**systemd**
	systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled (startup programs)


**user commands**
	
	usermod -aG wheel *username* (add user to the wheel group)
	

**grep**

*you could just read the man page*
	
	grep -i (case sensitive)

**kill**
	
	kill pid (kill a process)
	kill -STOP pid (stop (freeze) a process)
	kill -CONT pid (resume a stopped process)
	kill -INT  pid(ctrl c)
	Kill -KILL pid (also use kill -9. This absoulty destroys a process. Forcefully removes it from ram and ends its life without giving it any chance at shutting itself down gracefully)

**find**

	 find . -name "thing you want to delete" -delete (use find to delete things that you have found)


**DD**

*data duplicatior(destroyer)*

the if and of stand for input file and output file

	dd if=hdadisk.img of=/dev/sdb3 (restore from .img file to dev/sdb3)
	dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb (wipe /dev/sdb. /dev/zero is a special file that provides null characters)
	

**Rsync**

	ss (shows all tcp,udp and unix socket information)
	ss -l (show current listing sockets)
	ss -t -u -x (these flags are for showing tcp,udp and unix connections)
	ss -a (need to add to show listing sockets as well. Default is only established connections)
	ss dst x.x.x.x (show how you are connecting to an ip)
	
**tcpdump**

	indent <file> -kr -i8 (idnet code to linux kernel coding style)
	
	
**Scripting** 

	xargs <command> (will run against stdin line by line) 
	
**Fun**

This should be a simulate a cointoss 100 times then tell you how many times it landed on heads

*for some reason it does not always work, but it eventaully will if you keep running the command*

	shuf -r -n 100 -e Head Tail > headtail | grep "Head" headtail | wc -l
	
most used commands and percentages of them
	
	history | awk '{CMD[$2]++;count++;}END { for (a in CMD)print CMD[a] " " CMD[a]/count*100 "% " a;}' | grep -v "./" | column -c3 -s " " -t | sort -nr | nl |  head -n10


# Distro Specific Commands

**Gentoo-specific-commands**
Reference commands that I might need in the future 
this used to be  its own repo but I did not think that was nessessary





*Bluetooth*
 
 Bluetooth seems to be turned on by default (at least the btusb radio device is.) This saps a lot of power and is the top consumer of power in powertop when the system is idle
 
 To turn it off:
 
      emerge -av net-wireless/rfkill
      
      rfkill block bluetooth 
      
      
      
      

*portage errors*

when running emerge -av package_name, sometimes it says required by package *www-clinet/w3m  imlib* for example

     this means that you need to create a file name after the package_name /etc/portage/make.use directory and paste in the "required by    package part of the error" This should work.
     
     
     
**CentOS**

*install extexted packages*

	yum install epel-release
	
*remove dump files*

centos creates dump files by default. These can ocassionaly take up a lot of space. TO remove them
	 
	 sudo find . -name "core.[0-9]*" -delete

configure networking 

	nmtui (easy mode)
	 
	 

	

**Debian**

*get number of packages installed*

	dpkg -l
	

**Fedora**

*allow access to extended free and non free repos

	sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
