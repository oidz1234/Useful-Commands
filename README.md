	du -sh file_path (see size of directory)
	

	awk '{print $3;}' (this will print the 3rd word of the output, if you ran it against this sentace it will return the word print)


	using &! after running a command will put it fork the command to the background (&) and then disown (remove from the 'jobs' list) the command (!)

# Distro Specific Commands

**Gentoo-specific-commands**
Reference commands that I might need in the future 
this used to be  its own repo but I did not think that was nessessary





*Bluetooth*
 
 Bluetooth seems to be turned on by default (at least the btusb radio device is.) This saps a lot of power and is the top consumer of power in powertop when the system is idle
 
 To turn it off:
 
      emerge -av net-wireless/rfkill
      
      rfkill block bluetooth 
      
      
      
      

*portage errors*

when running emerge -av package_name, sometimes it says required by package *www-clinet/w3m  imlib* for example

     this means that you need to create a file name after the package_name /etc/portage/make.use directory and paste in the "required by    package part of the error" This should work.
     
     
     
**CentOS**

*install extexted packages*

	yum install epel-release
	
*remove dump files*

centos creates dump files by default. These can ocassionaly take up a lot of space. TO remove them
	 
	 sudo find . -name "core.[0-9]*" -delete

configure networking 

	nmtui (easy mode)
	
Add a gpg key

	rpm -Uvh <key.rpm>
	rpm --import <key.txt>
	 
	 

	

**Debian**

*get number of packages installed*

	dpkg -l
	

**Fedora**

*allow access to extended free and non free repos

	sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
